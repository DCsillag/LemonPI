    "content": "Tarts Anon is a fantastic, premium bakery nestled away in the back streets of Cremorne, you've gotta be looking for them. Their lemon tart is one of their signatures, with a very unique citrus layer above cream and a fantastic crust.\n\nThe tart base is firm, yet still edible with takeaway cutlery and the lemon layer melts in your mouth.\n\nI for one prefer a more homogenous mix of lemon tart filling, hence I'll deduct a point, but honestly this tart is great. At $11 its on the pricier side, but well worth a go.",
