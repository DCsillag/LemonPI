    content: "Lune's lemon tart is a masterpiece of pastry engineering. The crust is perfectly crisp yet delicate, with a buttery flavor that complements the filling without overwhelming it.\n\nThe lemon curd filling strikes an ideal balance between sweet and tart, with a smooth, silky texture that melts in your mouth. The acidity is bright and refreshing without being too sharp.\n\nWhat sets this tart apart is the attention to detail - the perfectly caramelized top, the hint of vanilla in the curd, and the consistent quality. Every bite is a revelation. Absolutely worth the queue that often forms outside this Fitzroy institution."

    content: "Agathé's lemon tart showcases authentic French pastry techniques with a Melbourne twist. The pastry shell is thin and crisp with a satisfying snap when you cut into it.\n\nThe lemon filling is intensely flavored and quite tart, which I personally enjoy. There's a subtle hint of zest that adds complexity and aroma. The texture is smooth but with a bit more density than some other tarts.\n\nThe presentation is simple but elegant, with a light dusting of powdered sugar. Located in the bustling South Melbourne Market, this is a perfect treat to enjoy after browsing the stalls."

    content: "Brunetti is a Melbourne institution, and their lemon tart is a reliable classic. The pastry is well-made though sometimes a bit thicker than I prefer.\n\nThe filling has a good lemon flavor, though it leans toward the sweeter side rather than embracing the natural tartness of lemons. The texture is consistent and smooth.\n\nWhat Brunetti lacks in innovation it makes up for in reliability - you always know what you're getting. The tart pairs well with their excellent coffee, making it a solid choice for an afternoon treat in Carlton."

    content: "Tivoli Road's lemon tart is a study in perfection. The pastry shell is made with cultured butter, giving it a subtle tanginess that complements the filling beautifully.\n\nThe lemon curd is exceptional - vibrant, glossy, and with the perfect wobble. It's tart and refreshing with just enough sweetness to balance the acidity. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in every bite.\n\nWhat I particularly love is their seasonal approach - sometimes the tart is garnished with fresh berries, other times with a light herb like lemon thyme. This South Yarra gem consistently delivers one of Melbourne's finest lemon tarts."

    content: "Baker D. Chirico approaches the lemon tart with an artisanal sensibility that's evident in every aspect. The pastry is rustic yet refined, with a beautiful golden color and crisp texture.\n\nThe filling is where this tart really shines - it's made with Amalfi lemons when in season, giving it a complex flavor profile with floral notes that elevate it beyond the ordinary. The texture is silky and luxurious.\n\nThe St Kilda location adds to the experience, making this a perfect treat to enjoy after a walk along the beach. While not as flashy as some other patisseries, Baker D. Chirico delivers substance and quality."
